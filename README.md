Now, let's assess the resource requirements and estimate the costs for processing and storing 100,000 documents:

OpenAI API Usage:

Assuming an average of 1,000 tokens per document for input and 500 tokens for output across all API calls.
Estimated API calls per document: 5 (classification, basic summary, analysis, insightful summary, fact-checking)
Total tokens per document: (1,000 + 500) * 5 = 7,500 tokens
Total tokens for 100,000 documents: 750 million tokens
Cost using GPT-4 API: $0.03 per 1K tokens for input, $0.06 per 1K tokens for output
Estimated API cost: (450M * $0.03 + 300M * $0.06) / 1000 = $31,500


Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone):

Assuming 1,000 vectors per document for context retrieval
Total vectors: 100 million
Pinecone cost for 100M vectors (Standard tier): ~$1,000 per month


Feedback Database:

Assuming a NoSQL database like MongoDB Atlas
Estimated storage need: ~10GB
MongoDB Atlas cost (dedicated cluster): ~$57 per month


Compute Resources:

For processing and model fine-tuning
AWS EC2 c5.4xlarge instance: ~$500 per month


Storage:

For storing original documents, summaries, and analysis results
Assuming 50KB per document on average
Total storage needed: ~5GB
AWS S3 Standard storage: ~$0.15 per month


Training Costs:

Assuming fine-tuning is done monthly on accumulated feedback
Estimated fine-tuning cost: $500 per month (this can vary significantly based on the extent of fine-tuning)



Total Estimated Costs:

One-time processing cost (API usage): $31,500
Monthly ongoing costs: $1,000 (Vector DB) + $57 (Feedback DB) + $500 (Compute) + $0.15 (Storage) + $500 (Training) â‰ˆ $2,057.15

Additional Considerations:

Data Transfer Costs: Not included, but should be considered based on your specific setup.
Human Resources: Costs for maintaining and improving the system, monitoring performance, and handling edge cases.
Scalability: As the number of documents grows, you may need to optimize the architecture for cost-efficiency.
Error Handling and Retry Logic: Implement robust error handling to minimize wasted API calls.
Caching: Implement caching strategies to reduce repeated API calls for similar content.

This system requires significant computational resources and relies heavily on the OpenAI API, which constitutes the major part of the cost. To optimize costs:

Implement efficient batching and caching strategies.
Consider using a less expensive model for initial processing steps.
Optimize the frequency of model updates based on performance improvements vs. cost.
Regularly review and clean up the vector and feedback databases to maintain relevance and reduce storage costs.

Remember, these are rough estimates and actual costs may vary based on implementation details, optimization strategies, and real-world usage patterns.
